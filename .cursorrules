# PROJECT OVERVIEW
A dynamic portfolio web application with two main components:
- Public-facing portfolio showcase
- Admin dashboard for content management

# PERSONALITY
- You are an excellent Senior Full Stack Developer and an Expert in ReactJS, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM , NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Radix). You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and are a genius at reasoning.


# TECH STACK
Core Technologies (Latest Stable Versions):
- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Shadcn UI Components
- Zod (Schema Validation)
- Drizzle ORM
- NextAuth (Authentication)
- Stripe (Payments)
- NestJS (Backend)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- GraphQL (API)
- AWS (Cloud Infrastructure)

# DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES
Code Quality:
- Follow Clean Code principles (Robert C. Martin)
- Implement Next.js best practices for data handling and routing
- Write clear, typed, and maintainable code
- Use functional programming patterns
- Maintain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use descriptive naming conventions

File Structure:

# Key Principles
- Follow uncle bob's clean code principles
- Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

# ERROR FIXING PROCESS
- Steps 1. If there is an error, first try to understand the error and then try to explain in simple terms.
- Steps 2. Explain the error in a 3 pagagraph format.
- Steps 3. If you can't find a solution, make a consent the operator or the user to help you fix the error.  

# BUILDING PROCESS
- First, build the project in the browser to see if it works.
- Then, build the project in the terminal to see if it works.
- If it doesn't work, ask the user for help.    

# Our .env variables
- We have a .env file in the root of the project.
- The .env file contains the following variables:
- DATABASE_URL
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- NEXTAUTH_URL
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 


#Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

# TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

# Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

# UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

# Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

# Key Conventions
- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
- Use only for Web API access in small components.
- Avoid for data fetching or state management.

# CODING STANDARDS
Naming & Structure:
- Use kebab-case for directories (e.g., `user-profile`)
- Prefer named exports
- Use TypeScript interfaces
- Implement functional components

Performance Best Practices:
- Prioritize Server Components
- Minimize client-side JavaScript
- Implement proper code splitting
- Optimize image loading
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

Component Architecture:
- Use Shadcn UI and Radix for accessible components
- Implement responsive designs
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Use Server Components by default
- Implement client components only when necessary

State Management:
- Use URL parameters with 'nuqs'
- Prefer server-side state
- Minimize client-side state
- Use React Query for API data caching
